*   **`hrms_project\attendance\views.py`**: Some general views, could be further distributed.

**Problem Areas and Proposed Solutions:**

1.  **Scattered Leave Type Logic & Validation:**
    *   **Problem:** Leave type specific rules (subtypes, validation, duration calculations) are spread across `init_leave_types.py`, `leave_request_form.html`, `LeaveRequestForm`, and potentially within views. This makes it hard to manage and update rules consistently.
    *   **Solution:** **Centralize Leave Type Rules in Models and Services.**
        *   **Enhance `LeaveType` Model:** Add fields directly to `LeaveType` to explicitly define rules.  Instead of hardcoding subtype choices in forms, store these choices (and potentially validation logic pointers) directly in `LeaveType`.  Consider adding fields like:
            *   `has_subtypes` (BooleanField): Indicates if the leave type has subtypes.
            *   `subtype_choices` (JSONField or CharField with choices as JSON): Stores available subtypes (e.g., for Annual Leave: "full_day", "half_day").
            *   `validation_method` (CharField):  Name of a validation function in the `LeaveRuleService`.
            *   `balance_deduction_method` (CharField): Name of a balance deduction function.
            *   `duration_calculation_method` (CharField): Name of a duration calculation function.
        *   **Create a `LeaveRuleService` (or enhance `LeaveService`):**  Move all leave-type specific logic into this service.  This service will contain functions referenced in `LeaveType` model (e.g., validation functions, balance calculation functions).  This will centralize the business logic.

2.  **Real-time Validation & User Feedback:**
    *   **Problem:**  "Immediate show if we can or not" implies a need for real-time validation, likely in the Leave Request Form. Current validation might be happening only on form submission.
    *   **Solution:** **Implement AJAX-based Validation in `LeaveRequestForm` & Utilize `LeaveRuleService`.**
        *   **Frontend (JavaScript - `attendance\static\attendance\js\leave_request_form.js`):**
            *   Use JavaScript to trigger validation on input changes (e.g., date changes, leave type change).
            *   Make AJAX calls to a new API endpoint (e.g., `/attendance/api/validate-leave-request/`) to perform server-side validation.
            *   Display validation messages (success or errors) immediately to the user without full page reload.
        *   **Backend (API View - in `attendance\api\views.py` or a new `leave_api_views.py`):**
            *   Create a new API view (`validate_leave_request_api`) that takes leave request data (leave type, dates, etc.) as input.
            *   This API view will use the `LeaveRuleService` to perform the validation logic (based on `LeaveType` and `LeaveRule` configurations).
            *   Return a JSON response indicating validation success or failure, including error messages.
        *   **`LeaveRuleService` Integration:** The `LeaveRuleService` will have functions to perform validation based on the leave type and rules, allowing the API view to easily call the service for validation.

3.  **Sick Leave Tiers & Complex Logic:**
    *   **Problem:** Tiered sick leave and other complex leave types (Hajj, Maternity, etc.) require specific logic that can become convoluted if not well-organized.
    *   **Solution:** **Model Subtypes & Logic in `LeaveType` & `LeaveRuleService`.**
        *   **`LeaveType.subtype_choices`:** Use this field (JSON or CharField) to define subtypes for leave types that have them (e.g., "tier1", "tier2", "tier3" for Sick Leave, "full_day", "half_day" for Annual Leave).
        *   **`LeaveRuleService` for Tier Logic:** Implement functions in `LeaveRuleService` to handle tier progression, balance allocation for each tier, and validation based on tier limits.  For example:
            *   `deduct_sick_leave_balance(employee, leave, subtype)` function could handle balance deduction based on the tier chosen.
            *   `get_available_sick_leave_balance_by_tier(employee)` function could return balance for each tier.
        *   **`LeaveRequestForm` Subtype Handling:**  Dynamically populate the `leave_sub_type` field in the form based on the `LeaveType` and its `subtype_choices`.  The form's `clean()` method, using the `LeaveRuleService`, will validate the selected subtype against the leave type.

4.  **One-Time Leaves (Hajj, Marriage etc.):**
    *   **Problem:** One-time leaves have special constraints (cannot be repeated, specific duration).
    *   **Solution:** **`LeaveRuleService` & `LeaveType` Configuration.**
        *   **`LeaveType.reset_period`:** Utilize the `reset_period` field in `LeaveType` to control the reset behavior (e.g., "NEVER" for Hajj, "EVENT" for Marriage/Paternity).
        *   **Validation in `LeaveRuleService`:** Implement validation logic in the `LeaveRuleService` to enforce one-time leave constraints (e.g., check if Hajj leave has already been taken).  This validation logic will be called from the API validation endpoint and the `LeaveRequestForm`'s `clean()` method.

5.  **Annual Leave & Half-Day Leave Together:**
    *   **Problem:**  Annual leave and Half-day leave share the same balance, requiring careful handling of deductions.
    *   **Solution:** **Unified Balance Management in `LeaveRuleService`.**
        *   **`LeaveRuleService` for Balance Deduction:**  The `LeaveRuleService` will have functions to deduct leave balance.  For half-day leaves, the deduction logic should correctly deduct 0.5 days from the annual leave balance.
        *   **`LeaveBalance` Model:** Ensure `LeaveBalance` model can handle decimal values for days to support half-day leaves correctly.

**Revised File Structure (Conceptual):**

*   **`hrms_project\attendance\models.py`:**
    *   `LeaveType` (Enhanced with rule-related fields like `subtype_choices`, `validation_method`, `balance_calculation_method`, etc.)
    *   `LeaveRule` (Optional - if separating rules into a separate model is preferred for better organization)
    *   (Other existing models)

*   **`hrms_project\attendance\services\`:**
    *   `leave_rule_service.py` (`LeaveRuleService` class containing all leave rule logic)
    *   (Other existing services - shift_service.py, ramadan_service.py, etc.)

*   **`hrms_project\attendance\api\`:**
    *   `leave_api_views.py` (`validate_leave_request_api` view and potentially other leave-related API views, separate from report views)
    *   `report_views.py`
    *   `urls.py` (Updated to include new API URLs)

*   **`hrms_project\attendance\forms.py`:**
    *   `LeaveRequestForm` (Simplified form, primarily for data collection and presentation, delegates validation to `LeaveRuleService`)
    *   (Other forms)

*   **`hrms_project\attendance\views\`:**
    *   `leave_views.py` (Streamlined views, primarily for UI flow and calling `LeaveRuleService`)
    *   (Other views - attendance_views.py, calendar_views.py, shifts_views.py, holiday_views.py, ramadan_views.py)

*   **`hrms_project\attendance\management\commands\`:**
    *   `init_leave_types.py` (Updated to use new `LeaveType`/`LeaveRule` structure)
    *   `reset_annual_leave.py` (Updated to use `LeaveRuleService`)
    *   (Other management commands)

*   **`hrms_project\attendance\static\attendance\js\`:**
    *   `leave_request_form.js` (JavaScript for real-time validation)
    *   (Other JS files)

**Key Improvements Summary:**

*   **Centralized Logic:** Move all leave rule logic to a dedicated `LeaveRuleService`.
*   **Explicit Rules in Models:** Define leave rules directly in `LeaveType` (or `LeaveRule`) models, making them more transparent and manageable.
*   **Real-time Validation:** Implement AJAX-based validation for a better user experience.
*   **Clearer Separation:** Separate form presentation, view flow control, and business logic into distinct components.
*   **Increased Maintainability:**  Make the system easier to understand, modify, and extend in the future.
