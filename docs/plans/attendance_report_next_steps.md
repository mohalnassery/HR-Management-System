# Attendance Report - Next Implementation Steps

## Current Status

The initial implementation provides:
- Comprehensive reporting framework
- Interactive web interface
- Multiple report types (attendance, leave, holiday)
- Export functionality (CSV, Excel, JSON)
- Cached report generation
- RESTful API endpoints

## Remaining Features to Implement

### 1. PDF Export Support
```python
# Add to ReportService:
def generate_pdf_report(data, report_type):
    """Generate PDF version of report"""
    # Use ReportLab or xhtml2pdf
    # Include charts and tables
    # Support proper formatting
```

### 2. Email Report Functionality
```python
# New tasks.py function:
@shared_task
def email_scheduled_report(report_type, recipients, **params):
    """Generate and email reports"""
    # Generate report
    # Create PDF attachment
    # Send email using Django's email system
```

### 3. Additional Report Types

#### A. Enhanced Absence Reports
- Track absence reasons
- Pattern analysis
- Department-wise absence rates
- Cost implications

#### B. Leave Balance Reports
- Current balance by employee
- Leave usage trends
- Low balance alerts
- Leave type distribution

#### C. Holiday Reports
- Holiday calendar view
- Optional holiday usage
- Department-wise holiday coverage
- Holiday impact analysis

### 4. Automation and Scheduling

#### A. Scheduled Reports
```python
# celery_tasks.py
@periodic_task(run_every=crontab(hour=0, minute=0))
def generate_daily_reports():
    """Generate and distribute daily reports"""
    # Generate reports
    # Export to configured formats
    # Email to stakeholders
```

#### B. Report Templates
- Save report configurations
- Schedule recurring reports
- Customize report layouts

## Implementation Priority

1. PDF Export Support (High)
   - Required for formal reporting
   - Needed for email functionality

2. Email Report Functionality (High)
   - Enable automated report distribution
   - Support scheduled reports

3. Enhanced Report Types (Medium)
   - Implement in phases based on user feedback
   - Start with most requested features

4. Automation and Scheduling (Medium)
   - Set up Celery tasks
   - Configure report templates

## Technical Requirements

1. Additional Dependencies:
```
reportlab==4.0.4
xhtml2pdf==0.2.11
celery==5.3.4

```

2. Database Changes:
- Report template model
- Report schedule model
- Enhanced absence tracking

3. New API Endpoints:

- Email trigger

## Next Steps

1. Create feature branches:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/pdf-export
git checkout -b feature/email-reports
git checkout -b feature/enhanced-reports
```

2. Implementation Order:
   a. PDF export functionality
