Okay, I've reviewed the code and identified several instances of duplicated code and areas where the workflow or logic could be simplified for better maintainability and adherence to the KISS principle. Here are my findings:

**File: `hrms_project\attendance\admin.py`**

*   **Duplicated Code:** The `employee_link` method is repeated in `ShiftAssignmentAdmin`, `AttendanceLogAdmin`, `AttendanceRecordAdmin`, and `LeaveAdmin`. This method generates a formatted HTML link to the employee change page in the admin interface.

    ```python
    def employee_link(self, obj):
        url = reverse('admin:employees_employee_change', args=[obj.employee.id])
        return format_html('<a href="{}">{}</a>', url, obj.employee)
    employee_link.short_description = 'Employee'
    ```

    **Suggestion:** Create a utility function or a base class for these Admin classes that provides this `employee_link` method. This promotes code reuse and reduces redundancy.

*   **Duplicated Code:** The `period_display` method is repeated in `ShiftAssignmentAdmin` and `LeaveAdmin`.  It formats the date range for display in the admin list.

    ```python
    def period_display(self, obj):
        if obj.end_date:
            return f"{obj.start_date.strftime('%b %d, %Y')} - {obj.end_date.strftime('%b %d, %Y')}"
        return f"From {obj.start_date.strftime('%b %d, %Y')} (Permanent)"
    period_display.short_description = 'Period'
    ```
    and
    ```python
    def period_display(self, obj):
        return f"{obj.start_date.strftime('%b %d, %Y')} - {obj.end_date.strftime('%b %d, %Y')}"
    period_display.short_description = 'Period'
    ```

    **Suggestion:**  Create a utility function or a method in a base Admin class to handle date range formatting. The logic can be made more generic to handle both cases (with and without `end_date`).

*   **Duplicated Code:** The `status_display` and `shift_type_display` methods in `AttendanceLogAdmin` and `ShiftAdmin` respectively, which use `format_html` to color-code the status or shift type based on its value.

    ```python
    def status_display(self, obj): # in AttendanceLogAdmin
        status_colors = { ... } # status color mapping
        color = status_colors.get(obj.status, 'gray')
        return format_html('<span style="color: {};">{}</span>', color, obj.get_status_display())

    def shift_type_display(self, obj): # in ShiftAdmin
        shift_colors = { ... } # shift color mapping
        color = shift_colors.get(obj.shift_type, 'gray')
        return format_html('<span style="color: {};">{}</span>', color, obj.get_shift_type_display())
    ```

    **Suggestion:**  Create a generic function (or a method in a base Admin class) that takes the object, value, and a color mapping dictionary as input and returns the formatted HTML span with color.

**File: `hrms_project\attendance\api\report_views.py`**

*   **Duplicated Code & Wrong Workflow:**  Date validation and parameter extraction logic are repeated in the `attendance`, `leave`, `holiday`, and `export` actions.  This includes:
    *   Retrieving `start_date` and `end_date` from `request.query_params`.
    *   Validating the presence of `start_date` and `end_date`.
    *   Parsing dates using `datetime.strptime`.
    *   Checking if `start_date > end_date`.
    *   Handling optional parameters like `departments`, `employees`, `status`, and `leave_types`.

    **Suggestion:** Create a utility function or a decorator to handle common report parameter validation and extraction. This function could:
        1.  Take expected parameters (start\_date, end\_date, optional params) as input.
        2.  Extract and validate dates, raising `ValidationError` if invalid.
        3.  Extract optional parameters, handling list inputs correctly.
        4.  Return a dictionary of validated parameters.
        This will significantly reduce code duplication and make the view actions cleaner and more readable.

*   **Duplicated Code:**  The `export` action repeats the parameter extraction and validation logic from the other report actions. It also repeats the logic to get report data based on `report_type` (using `if/elif/else` to call `ReportService.get_attendance_report`, `get_leave_report`, `get_holiday_report`).

    **Suggestion:** Refactor the `export` action to reuse the parameter validation logic (from the suggested utility function/decorator).  Also, create a more dynamic way to call the appropriate `ReportService` method based on the `report_type`.  Consider using a dictionary mapping `report_type` to service methods.

*   **Workflow Improvement:** The export format handling in the `export` action is a long `if/elif/else` block.

    **Suggestion:** Create a dictionary mapping `export_format` to export handler methods (`_export_csv`, `_export_excel`, `_export_pdf`, etc.). This will make the code more extensible and easier to read.

*   **Workflow Improvement:** The PDF export methods (`_export_pdf`) in `ReportViewSet` and CSV/Excel export methods (`_export_csv`, `_export_excel`) have very similar structures, especially in setting up the `HttpResponse` and handling potential exceptions.

    **Suggestion:** Create a base export handler function that takes the data, report type, and export format, and handles common tasks like setting up the `HttpResponse` and error handling. The specific format logic can be passed as a callback function or strategy pattern.

**File: `hrms_project\attendance\apps.py`**

*   **Duplicated Code:** The `post_save.connect` and `post_delete.connect` patterns are repeated for `AttendanceRecord`, `Leave`, and `Holiday` models.

    ```python
    post_save.connect(signals.process_attendance_record, sender='attendance.AttendanceRecord')
    post_delete.connect(signals.cleanup_attendance_record, sender='attendance.AttendanceRecord')

    post_save.connect(signals.process_leave_request, sender='attendance.Leave')
    post_delete.connect(signals.cleanup_leave_request, sender='attendance.Leave')

    post_save.connect(signals.process_holiday, sender='attendance.Holiday')
    post_delete.connect(signals.cleanup_holiday, sender='attendance.Holiday')
    ```

    **Suggestion:** While not strictly duplicated code in terms of content, the pattern is repetitive. If there are many more models requiring similar signal connections, consider a more dynamic way to register these signals, perhaps by iterating through a list of models and signal handler functions. For now, the repetition is fairly contained and readable.

*   **Workflow Improvement:** The Celery task scheduling in `ready()` method is done by manually updating `settings.CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE`.

    **Suggestion:** While this is a common way to schedule tasks, consider using Celery Beat's declarative configuration if possible, or move the schedule definition to `hrms_project\attendance\schedules.py` and dynamically load them in `ready()` to improve organization and separation of concerns. However, the current approach is reasonably clear for this amount of scheduled tasks.

**File: `hrms_project\attendance\cache.py`**

*   **Duplicated Code:** Cache key generation functions (`get_employee_shift_cache_key`, `get_ramadan_period_cache_key`, etc.) follow a similar pattern: `CACHE_KEYS['key_name'].format(...)`.

    **Suggestion:**  Create a single function that takes the key name and format arguments and generates the cache key. This centralizes key generation and makes it easier to modify the key structure in the future.

*   **Duplicated Code:** Cache management classes (`ShiftCache`, `RamadanCache`, `AttendanceMetricsCache`) have very similar structures: `get_metrics`, `set_metrics`, `clear_metrics` methods, often with similar docstrings.

    **Suggestion:** Create a base `CacheManager` class with generic `get`, `set`, `clear` methods.  Subclasses like `ShiftCache`, `RamadanCache`, etc., can inherit from this base class and define only the specific cache keys and timeouts. This would significantly reduce code duplication and make the cache management code more DRY.

*   **Workflow Improvement:** The `RamadanCache.clear_all_periods()` method iterates through the entire year to clear cache for each day.

    **Suggestion:** While functionally correct, this might be inefficient if the cache backend supports wildcard deletion or bulk delete operations. If the cache backend (like Redis or Memcached) supports it, consider using a more efficient way to clear caches based on a pattern (e.g., clearing all keys that start with `ramadan_period_`).  For `LocMemCache`, the current approach is fine.

**File: `hrms_project\attendance\forms.py`**

*   **Duplicated Code:** The `__init__` methods in `HolidayForm`, `LeaveBalanceUploadForm`, and `LeaveRequestForm` are used to update widget attributes (like adding `form-control` class).

    **Suggestion:** Create a base `BaseForm` class that includes common widget attribute updates in its `__init__` method.  Other forms can inherit from this base class to avoid repetition. Alternatively, consider using Django Crispy Forms which might provide more elegant ways to handle form rendering and styling.

*   **Workflow Improvement:** The `LeaveRequestForm.clean()` method checks for date validity and duration type constraints. This validation logic could be potentially reused if other forms or serializers need similar date range validation.

    **Suggestion:**  Extract the date validation logic in `LeaveRequestForm.clean()` into a reusable function or a mixin that can be used across different forms or serializers.

**File: `hrms_project\attendance\management\commands\cleanup_shifts.py`**

*   **Duplicated Code:** The structure of `cleanup_shift_assignments`, `cleanup_ramadan_periods`, and `cleanup_orphaned_shifts` functions is very similar:
    1.  Query for objects to be cleaned up based on some criteria.
    2.  Count the objects found.
    3.  Log the count.
    4.  If not dry run, optionally archive, then delete.
    5.  Log deletion count.

    **Suggestion:**  Create a generic cleanup function that takes the queryset, object type name (for logging), and archive function (optional) as arguments.  These specific cleanup functions can then call this generic function, passing in their specific querysets and parameters. This will significantly reduce code duplication and make the command more maintainable.

*   **Duplicated Code:** The `archive_assignments` and `archive_ramadan_periods` functions are very similar, differing mainly in the model they are archiving and the CSV header.

    **Suggestion:** Create a generic archive function that takes the queryset, filename prefix, and CSV header as arguments.  The specific archive functions can then call this generic function, passing in their model-specific data.

*   **Workflow Improvement:** The cache clearing logic in `clear_caches()` iterates through departments to invalidate department caches.

    **Suggestion:** If there are more cache clearing operations needed in the future, consider creating a more centralized cache invalidation service or utility function that can handle various cache clearing tasks based on different criteria (e.g., clear all employee caches, clear all department caches, clear all report caches).

**File: `hrms_project\attendance\management\commands\generate_holidays.py`**

*   **Duplicated Code:** The date validation logic (checking if it's December or `--force` flag is set) is likely to be repeated in other year-end or periodic management commands (e.g., `year_end_processing.py`, `reset_annual_leave.py`).

    **Suggestion:** Create a utility function or a decorator to encapsulate this date validation logic.  This can be reused across management commands that should only be run in December or with a force flag.

*   **Workflow Improvement:** The holiday generation process iterates through recurring holidays and checks for existing holidays in the target year before creating new ones.

    **Suggestion:**  While the current logic is functional, consider using `bulk_create` for potentially better performance when creating multiple holidays, if applicable and if it fits the logic (e.g., if you can prepare all `Holiday` instances in a list before saving).

**File: `hrms_project\attendance\management\commands\generate_report.py`**

*   **Duplicated Code:** Date range calculation logic (daily, weekly, monthly, custom) is somewhat repeated in the `handle` method.

    **Suggestion:** Extract the date range calculation logic into a separate function that takes `report_type`, `start_date`, and `end_date` options as input and returns the calculated `start_date` and `end_date`.

*   **Duplicated Code:** The structure of `_generate_employee_report`, `_generate_department_report`, and `_generate_organization_report` functions is similar:
    1.  Fetch relevant data (employees, departments, attendance logs, leaves, etc.).
    2.  Calculate statistics (attendance rate, leave stats, etc.).
    3.  Prepare `report_data` dictionary.
    4.  Call `_save_report` to save the report in different formats.

    **Suggestion:**  Consider refactoring these functions to share more common logic.  Perhaps create a base report generation function that handles data fetching, basic report structure setup, and calls format-specific saving functions.  Sub-functions can then focus on calculating statistics and preparing data specific to each report type.

*   **Duplicated Code:** The `_save_report` function has similar logic for handling different output formats (HTML, CSV, JSON), especially in file path construction and file opening.

    **Suggestion:** Create a base save function that handles filepath creation and file opening.  The format-specific content writing logic can be passed as a callback function or strategy pattern.

*   **Workflow Improvement:** The CSV and JSON export methods (`_write_csv_data`, `_prepare_json_data`) are very basic and might not be flexible enough for more complex reports in the future.

    **Suggestion:** Consider using more robust libraries or approaches for CSV and JSON export, especially if you need more control over formatting, handling nested data, or exporting more complex data structures. For CSV, the current `csv.writer` is reasonable for simple cases. For JSON, consider using Django's serializers or DRF serializers for model instances if you need more complex serialization.

**File: `hrms_project\attendance\management\commands\import_attendance.py`**

*   **Duplicated Code:** The column name detection logic (iterating through `employee_id_cols`, `timestamp_cols`, etc.) is repeated for each column type.

    **Suggestion:** Create a utility function that takes a list of possible column names and the DataFrame columns and returns the first matching column name. This function can be reused for all column types.

*   **Workflow Improvement:** The error handling within the `for` loop is quite verbose, with multiple `try-except` blocks.

    **Suggestion:**  Consider simplifying error handling. You could log errors to a file instead of printing to stdout/stderr in the command line for less noisy output during bulk import. Also, group related error handling logic together.

**File: `hrms_project\attendance\management\commands\init_leave_types.py`**

*   **Workflow Improvement:** The leave type definitions are hardcoded as a list of dictionaries.

    **Suggestion:**  While acceptable for initial data, consider storing these definitions in a more configurable way if they are expected to change frequently or if you want to allow users to customize the initial leave types. A JSON or YAML file could be an alternative.

**File: `hrms_project\attendance\management\commands\init_ramadan_periods.py`**

*   **Duplicated Code:** The period creation logic (update or create, or only create) is somewhat repeated for both `--force` and non-`--force` cases.

    **Suggestion:**  Refactor the period creation logic to reduce repetition.  You could have a single block of code that handles period creation/update, and conditionally decide whether to update or create based on the `--force` option.

*   **Duplicated Code:** The period validation logic in `validate_period()` is also present in `RamadanService.validate_period_dates()`.

    **Suggestion:** Remove the duplicated validation logic from the command and reuse `RamadanService.validate_period_dates()`.

**File: `hrms_project\attendance\management\commands\recalculate_leave_balance.py`**

*   **Duplicated Code:** The logic to get employees and leave types to process based on command line options is repeated.

    **Suggestion:** Create utility functions to fetch employees and leave types based on filters (employee ID, leave type code). These functions can be reused in other commands that need to process employees and leave types.

*   **Duplicated Code:** The output formatting and logging of leave balance details within the nested loops is repeated.

    **Suggestion:**  Create a utility function to format and log leave balance information. This function can take the `LeaveBalance` object and output stream as input and handle the formatting and writing.

**File: `hrms_project\attendance\management\commands\reprocess_attendance.py`**

*   **Duplicated Code:** The date filtering logic (handling `--date` and `--date-range` options) is repeated.

    **Suggestion:** Create a utility function to handle date filtering based on command line arguments. This function can take the queryset and the options dictionary as input and return the filtered queryset.

**File: `hrms_project\attendance\management\commands\reset_annual_leave.py`**

*   **Duplicated Code:** The employee and leave type iteration is repeated.

    **Suggestion:** Reuse the employee and leave type fetching utility functions suggested earlier.

*   **Duplicated Code:** The balance reset and transaction creation logic is repeated within the employee loop.

    **Suggestion:**  Create a function to handle the balance reset and transaction creation for a single employee and leave type. This function can be called within the employee loop to reduce duplication.

**File: `hrms_project\attendance\management\commands\year_end_processing.py`**

*   **Workflow Improvement:** The year-end processing command calls other management commands (`reset_annual_leave`, `generate_holidays`, `generate_report`) using `call_command`.

    **Suggestion:** While `call_command` is a valid approach, consider if directly importing and calling the relevant functions from those commands might be more efficient and provide better control over the execution flow within `year_end_processing.py`. However, `call_command` is a good way to reuse existing commands and keep concerns separated.

*   **Duplicated Code:** The archiving logic in `_archive_old_records` is specific to each model (AttendanceRecord, AttendanceLog, Leave, LeaveBalance, Holiday) but follows a similar pattern of filtering by year and updating `is_active` and `archived_at` fields.

    **Suggestion:** Create a generic archive function that takes the model, date field name, and `year` as arguments.  The `_archive_old_records` function can then call this generic function for each model, passing in the specific model and date field.

*   **Duplicated Code:** The report generation logic in `_generate_year_end_reports` calls `generate_report` command multiple times with different parameters (report type, department, output file).

    **Suggestion:** If report generation logic becomes more complex, consider creating a more structured way to define and generate year-end reports, perhaps using a configuration file or a more programmatic approach instead of repeated `call_command` calls. However, the current approach is reasonably clear for this number of reports.

**File: `hrms_project\attendance\models.py`**

*   **Workflow Improvement:** The `Shift` model has a `SHIFT_PRIORITIES` dictionary and a `@property priority` method.

    **Suggestion:**  Consider making `SHIFT_PRIORITIES` a class-level constant instead of an instance-level property, as it's unlikely to change per instance of `Shift`.

*   **Workflow Improvement:** The `Shift.get_default_shifts()` method returns a hardcoded list of default shift configurations.

    **Suggestion:** Consider storing these default shift configurations in a more configurable way, such as in settings or a JSON/YAML file, if they are expected to be customized or expanded in the future.

**File: `hrms_project\attendance\schedules.py`**

*   **Workflow Improvement:** The schedule configurations are hardcoded in dictionaries.

    **Suggestion:** While acceptable for a small number of tasks, for larger and more complex schedules, consider using a more data-driven approach, perhaps loading schedule configurations from a database or a configuration file. This would make the schedule more dynamic and easier to manage without code changes.

**File: `hrms_project\attendance\serializers.py`**

*   **Duplicated Code:** The `SerializerMethodField` for getting employee names (`employee_name`, `edited_by_name`, `created_by_name`) is repeated in multiple serializers (`AttendanceRecordSerializer`, `AttendanceLogSerializer`, `AttendanceEditSerializer`, `LeaveSerializer`, `HolidaySerializer`).

    ```python
    employee_name = serializers.SerializerMethodField()

    def get_employee_name(self, obj):
        return obj.employee.get_full_name()
    ```

    **Suggestion:** Create a base serializer class or a mixin that provides a generic `employee_name` `SerializerMethodField` and `get_employee_name` method.  Other serializers can inherit from or use this mixin to avoid repetition.

*   **Workflow Improvement:** The `AttendanceLogSerializer.get_status()` method contains conditional logic to determine status based on leave, holiday, and lateness.

    **Suggestion:**  While the logic is specific to attendance status, if this kind of conditional status determination logic becomes more complex or needs to be reused in other serializers, consider creating a reusable utility function or a method in a base serializer class to handle status resolution based on different conditions.

**File: `hrms_project\attendance\services\attendance_status_service.py`**

*   **Workflow Improvement:** The `calculate_status()` method retrieves the `ShiftService` and `RamadanService` inside the function scope.

    ```python
    from .shift_service import ShiftService
    from .ramadan_service import RamadanService
    ```

    **Suggestion:** Import these services at the module level instead of inside the function to avoid repeated imports within the function scope.

*   **Workflow Improvement:** The work duration calculation in `calculate_work_duration()` and status calculation in `calculate_status()` both retrieve shift timings using `ShiftService.get_shift_timing`.

    **Suggestion:** Consider fetching the shift timing once at the beginning of either method and passing it around to avoid redundant calls to `ShiftService.get_shift_timing`.

**File: `hrms_project\attendance\services\leave_balance_service.py`**

*   **Duplicated Code:** The structure of `recalculate_balance` and `recalculate_all_balances` methods is similar:
    1.  Get employees or leave types to process.
    2.  Iterate through them and call a core recalculation function.
    3.  Handle transactions.
    4.  Return results.

    **Suggestion:** Create a generic recalculation function that takes employee and leave type filters as arguments and handles the core recalculation logic and transaction management.  `recalculate_balance` and `recalculate_all_balances` can then call this generic function with their specific filters.

**File: `hrms_project\attendance\services\pdf_service.py`**

*   **Duplicated Code:** The structure of `generate_attendance_report_pdf`, `generate_leave_report_pdf`, and `generate_holiday_report_pdf` is very similar:
    1.  Render HTML string from template.
    2.  Set up font configuration.
    3.  Get CSS.
    4.  Create PDF using `weasyprint`.
    5.  Handle temporary files.
    6.  Return PDF content.

    **Suggestion:** Create a generic PDF generation function that takes the data, template name, and report type as arguments and handles the common PDF generation steps.  The specific report PDF generation functions can then call this generic function, passing in their specific template names and data.

**File: `hrms_project\attendance\services\ramadan_service.py`**

*   **Duplicated Code:** The period creation and update methods (`create_period`, `update_period`) have similar validation logic (year consistency, overlap checks).

    **Suggestion:** Extract the common validation logic into a separate function that can be reused by both `create_period` and `update_period`.

*   **Duplicated Code:** The period validation logic in `validate_period_dates()` and `RamadanPeriodAdmin.validate_period()` are doing similar checks.

    **Suggestion:** Consolidate the validation logic into a single place, preferably in `RamadanService.validate_period_dates()`, and reuse it in both the service and the admin form validation (if needed in admin).

**File: `hrms_project\attendance\services\report_service.py`**

*   **Duplicated Code:** The cache key generation logic in `_get_cache_key` is repeated and could be made more generic (similar to cache key generation in `cache.py`).

    **Suggestion:** Reuse the cache key generation function suggested for `cache.py` or create a similar utility function specifically for report service cache keys.

*   **Workflow Improvement:** The report generation methods (`get_attendance_report`, `get_leave_report`, `get_holiday_report`) have similar structures, especially in cache checking, parameter handling, and returning report data.

    **Suggestion:**  Consider creating a base report generation function that handles cache management and basic report structure setup.  Sub-functions can then focus on fetching data and calculating statistics specific to each report type.

**File: `hrms_project\attendance\services.py`** (older services file)

*   This file seems to contain older or potentially redundant services (`AttendanceStatusService`, `FridayRuleService`, `LeaveBalanceService`, `LeaveRequestService`, `RecurringHolidayService`, `RamadanService`, `HolidayService`) that might overlap with the newer services in the `hrms_project\attendance\services\*` directory.

    **Suggestion:** Review this file carefully and determine if any of these services are redundant or if their functionality is better handled by the newer services. Consolidate or remove redundant code to simplify the codebase and avoid confusion.

**File: `hrms_project\attendance\signals.py`**

*   **Duplicated Code:** Cache clearing logic is repeated in multiple signal handlers (e.g., `handle_shift_assignment_update`, `handle_shift_assignment_create`, `handle_shift_assignment_delete`, `handle_shift_changes`, `handle_ramadan_period_change`).  Clearing employee shift cache (`cache.delete(cache_key)`) and Ramadan period cache (`RamadanCache.clear_active_period(current_date)`) are repeated.

    **Suggestion:** Create utility functions for clearing employee shift cache, Ramadan period cache, and department caches.  Signal handlers can then call these utility functions to centralize cache invalidation logic and reduce duplication.

**File: `hrms_project\attendance\static\attendance\js\attendance_report.js`**

*   **Duplicated Code:** The `getReportParameters` and `handleExportFormat` functions are almost identical in `hrms_project\attendance\static\attendance\js\attendance_report.js` and `hrms_project\attendance\static\attendance\js\shifts.js` (in the context of calendar report generation).

    **Suggestion:**  Move these functions to a common JavaScript file (e.g., `hrms_project\attendance\static\attendance\js\report_utils.js`) and reuse them across different JavaScript files to avoid duplication.

**File: `hrms_project\attendance\management\commands\year_end_processing.py`**

*   **Workflow Improvement:** The `_generate_year_end_reports` method hardcodes the output paths for reports.

    **Suggestion:**  Make the output directory and filenames configurable, perhaps using settings or command line arguments, to allow for more flexibility in report output management.

**General Suggestions across the module:**

*   **Utility Modules/Functions:** Consider creating utility modules (e.g., `hrms_project\attendance\utils\validation_utils.py`, `hrms_project\attendance\utils\report_utils.py`, `hrms_project\attendance\utils\cache_utils.py`) to house reusable functions for validation, report generation, cache management, and other common tasks. This will promote code reuse and improve code organization.
*   **Base Classes/Mixins:** Utilize base classes and mixins to extract common functionality from Admin classes, serializers, forms, and services. This will reduce code duplication and make the codebase more object-oriented and maintainable.
*   **DRY Principle:**  Continuously apply the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle throughout the codebase. Whenever you find yourself writing similar code multiple times, think about how you can refactor it into a reusable function, class, or module.
*   **Configuration over Hardcoding:** Move hardcoded configurations (like default shift types, leave type definitions, schedule configurations, report output paths) to settings, configuration files (JSON, YAML), or database tables to make the system more flexible and customizable without code changes.

By addressing these areas, you can significantly improve the maintainability, readability, and efficiency of your attendance module, making it easier to extend and adapt in the future. Remember to prioritize the most impactful changes first, focusing on reducing the most significant instances of code duplication and workflow inefficiencies.
